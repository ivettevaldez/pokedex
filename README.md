# Pokédex

The **Pokédex** is an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. It gives information about all Pokémon in the world that are contained in its database.

Pokédex entries provide a `description` of a Pokémon in only two or three sentences. They may give background information on the habitat or activities of a Pokémon in the wild or other information on the Pokémon's history or anatomy. Pokédex entries also include `types`, `height`, `weight`, `abilities`, and a `picture` of the Pokémon. 

This Android application allows you to browse through [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) data and check detailed information about the emblematic first **150 Pokémon**. You can:

- See a list of Pokémon.
- Search for a Pokémon by its name if you know it.
- Tap a Pokémon to see its detailed information.
